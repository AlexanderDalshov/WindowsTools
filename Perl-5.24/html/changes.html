<p>For the latest information on ActivePerl, please see:</p>

<pre><code>    http://www.ActiveState.com/ActivePerl/</code></pre>

<h2 id="Build-2402-January-2017">Build 2402, January 2017</h2>

<p>Build 2402 is identical to build 2401 with the exception of the core, which has been updated to 5.24.1. For the non-core changes, refer to the section on build 2401 below.</p>

<p><i>Bug Fixes and Changes since build 2401</i></p>

<ul>

<li><p>The following security vulnerabilities have been addressed:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="CVE-2016-1238">CVE-2016-1238</dt>
<dd>

<p>The tools and many modules supplied in core no longer search the default current directory entry in @INC for optional modules. For example, Storable will remove the final &quot;.&quot; from @INC before trying to load Log::Agent.</p>

<p>This prevents an attacker injecting an optional module into a process run by another user where the current directory is writable by the attacker, e.g. the /tmp directory.</p>

<p>In most cases this removal should not cause problems, but difficulties were encountered with base, which treats every module name supplied as optional. These difficulties have not yet been resolved, so for this release there are no changes to base. The Perl team hopes to have a fix for base in Perl 5.24.2.</p>

<p>Please see <a href="./lib/pods/perldelta.html">perldelta</a> for more information on how to protect your own code from this attack.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="CVE-2016-6185">CVE-2016-6185</dt>
<dd>

<p>XSLoader contained a security hole in which binary files could be loaded from a path outside of @INC.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

</li>
<li><p>Significant changes that have occurred in the Perl 5.24.1 release are documented in <a href="./lib/pods/perldelta.html">perldelta</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Most bundled modules have been updated to their latest released version from CPAN. Use the <code>ppm query</code> command to check the exact version included in this release.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Build-2401-January-2017">Build 2401, January 2017</h2>

<p>Build 2401 is a mid-cycle release with updated libraries and modules only. It contains the same core version as the previous build, 5.24.0.</p>

<h2 id="Build-2400-June-2016">Build 2400, June 2016</h2>

<p><i>What&#39;s new in the 2400 Series</i></p>

<ul>

<li><p>This build corresponds to the Perl 5.24.0 source code release.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The 2400 series builds of ActivePerl are not binary compatible with builds in the 2200 or earlier series. Any extensions built using binaries from the ActivePerl 2200 or earlier series will need to be recompiled. Note especially that this applies to PPM packages that may have been built for earlier series of ActivePerl.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Significant changes that have occurred since the 5.22 release are documented in <a href="./lib/pods/perl5240delta.html">perl5240delta</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Most bundled distributions have been updated to their latest released version from CPAN. Use the <code>ppm list</code> command to check the exact version of all modules included in this release.</p>
